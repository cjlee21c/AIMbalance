Hi, everyoneüëã \
If you are passonate gym goer, this is the perfect place to explore!!\
"AIMbalance" is a full-stack web application designed to help users improve their balance and form during workout through real-time pose detection and personal data analysis system.

## About this project
* I decided to do this project because I started to have serious imbalance of body for last 6 months and it affected my SBD (squat, deadlift, bench press) weights, performance, and overall quality of my life. Not being able to perform my best condition and power meant no growth of muscle and strength and it was **UNACCEPTABLE** for me.

* You might lift weights by just looking at your posture through mirror and trying to fix form intentionally, but it is definitely not the most ideal way to fix, and it would rather cause other serious injuries. Your exercises have to be performed with natural movement without disturbance. 
* So, how should we deal with it? The answer is finding **fundamental reasons** that cause imbalance form. Let's say when you do shoulder press and you notice your right arm is going upper than the other one. You should not just think your right arm is stronger than the other one in that moment. Rather, you should find out whether your Pectorails minor is tight, Scapulae is imbalanced, or core muscle is weak through personal data and analysis.

## Pose Detection with MoveNet

Pose estimation involves using computer vision techniques to identify the positions of key human joints (17 key points), such as the elbow, in images and videos. It's important to note that while pose estimation can locate these joints, it does not identify the person in the image or video.
